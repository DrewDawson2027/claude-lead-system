# 2-Min Demo Script (Narration)

- "I have two Claude terminals in one repo. Normally they conflict."
- "I run `/lead` and instantly see all sessions."
- "I send work to another session with `tell` and it receives inbox instructions."
- "I run `conflicts` and catch file overlap before merge pain."
- "I spawn an autonomous worker and get output/status without manual babysitting."
- "Coordination happened outside the context window with zero API-token orchestration overhead."
